# Customer Segmentation Using Tableau Data Science Project
## Overview
This data science project focuses on customer segmentation using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. By leveraging the data visualization capabilities of Tableau, we aim to explore and understand customer segments visually, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights for marketing strategies, product development, and customer engagement.

## Project Steps
## 1. Data Collection and Preparation
Collect the relevant customer data needed for segmentation. This may include demographic information, purchase history, website interactions, customer feedback, or any other relevant data sources. Prepare and clean the data for analysis, ensuring it is in a format suitable for Tableau. Link to dataset https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabiendaniel/customer-segmentation/input

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform exploratory data analysis using Tableau to gain insights into the dataset. Create visualizations and dashboards to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers or missing values, and explore relationships between different attributes. This step helps in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the data and identifying potential features for customer segmentation.

## 3. Define Segmentation Criteria
Define the criteria for customer segmentation based on the project objectives and the available data. This could include demographic factors, purchasing behavior, customer preferences, or any other relevant variables. Determine the number of segments desired and the attributes that will differentiate one segment from another.

## 4. Data Preparation for Segmentation
Prepare the data for customer segmentation in Tableau. This involves selecting the relevant variables, creating calculated fields if necessary, and transforming the data to meet the segmentation criteria. Ensure the data is in a format suitable for Tableau's segmentation analysis.

## 5. Segmentation Analysis
Perform customer segmentation analysis using Tableau's built-in features or advanced analytics tools. Utilize clustering algorithms, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, to group customers based on their attributes. Explore different segmentation techniques available in Tableau and select the most appropriate one for your project.

## 6. Visualization of Segments
Visualize the customer segments using Tableau's visualization capabilities. Create visualizations, charts, or dashboards to represent the segments and their characteristics. Use color coding, size, or other visual cues to differentiate between segments and highlight their unique attributes. This step helps in visually understanding the differences between segments and identifying patterns or trends.

## 7. Analysis and Insights
Analyze the customer segments visually and derive meaningful insights. Explore the characteristics, behaviors, and preferences of each segment using Tableau's interactive features. Identify key features or variables that differentiate one segment from another. Use tooltips, filters, or drill-down capabilities to dive deeper into segment-specific details.

## 8. Strategy Development
Based on the insights derived from customer segmentation, develop targeted strategies for each customer segment. Use Tableau's visualizations to identify opportunities for marketing campaigns, product recommendations, pricing strategies, or customer experiences tailored to each segment. This helps in improving customer satisfaction, retention, and overall business performance.

## Conclusion
The customer segmentation using Tableau data science project provides a powerful and visual approach to understanding and analyzing customer segments. By leveraging Tableau's data visualization capabilities, we can explore customer characteristics, behaviors, and preferences visually. The project helps in deriving actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies, product development, and customer engagement. Tableau's interactive features and visualizations enable effective communication of the segmentation results and facilitate data-driven decision-making within the organization.
